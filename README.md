## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This project creates and trains a deep convolutional neural network from scratch, with the task of classifying German traffic signs using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The trained model is subsequently tested on German traffic signs found on the web.

### Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.5 and the following Python libraries installed:

* Jupyter
* NumPy
* SciPy
* scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* PIL
* OpenCV


### Dataset 

This project uses the German Traffic Sign Dataset. A pickled version that has images resized to 32x32 is available here. The pickle file was used as the raw data for this project.


### How to run

You can step through the Jupyter Notebook at Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb, or you can read the HTML export of the notebook at Traffic_Signs_Classfier.html.
